Very good. But the tsc compiler is giving an error "index.ts:1:8 - error TS1192: Module '"fs"' has no default export.

1 import fs from 'fs';
"

Response
I apologize for the confusion. The fs module in Node.js does not have a default export, so you should import it using the CommonJS syntax instead of the ES module syntax. Here's the updated code with the corrected import statement for the fs module:
import * as fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

// Rest of the code remains the same...
By using the import * as fs syntax, you import the entire fs module into the fs namespace, allowing you to access its methods and properties.

Please replace the previous import statement with this updated one, and the TypeScript compiler error should be resolved. Let me know if you encounter any further issues
