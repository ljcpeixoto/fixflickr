Very good, but I need some corrections. First, rewrite the code in typescript.

Response
Certainly! Here's the TypeScript version of the code:
<script>
In this version, I added TypeScript type annotations to the variables and function parameters to provide better static type checking and improve code readability. Remember to replace <path_to_backup_directory> and <path_to_restore_directory> with the actual paths to the directories you're using.

You can compile and run this TypeScript script using the TypeScript compiler (tsc) and then run the generated JavaScript file using Node.js (node script.js). Let me know if you have any further questions or if you need additional improvements.
