Please change  the line "import path from 'path';" to "import * as path from 'path';"

Response
Apologies for the oversight. Here's the modified code with the correct import statement:
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';

// Rest of the code remains the same...

With this change, the path module will be imported correctly using the * as path syntax.
