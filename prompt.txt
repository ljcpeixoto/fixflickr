Please restore the code searching the photoFile - you should have altered the code searching for the Info File (photoInfo), with the above rules.

Response
Apologies for the confusion. Here's the corrected code that searches for the photo file instead of the info file:
<script>
Please replace <default_backup_directory> and <default_restore_directory> with the default directories you want to use if the arguments are not provided.
