Good. Please remember to apply the same fix to the import of "path" in future code.

Response
Certainly! I apologize for the oversight. In the future code, I'll ensure to use the appropriate import syntax for the "path" module as well. Thank you for pointing that out.

If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

Please add an interface for Photo, which follows the example that I will give you next.

Response
Certainly! Please provide me with an example of the Photo structure, and I'll create an interface based on that example.

Based on the example you provided, here's an interface for the Photo object:
interface Photo {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  count_views: string;
  count_faves: string;
  count_comments: string;
  date_taken: string;
  count_tags: string;
  count_notes: string;
  rotation: number;
  date_imported: string;
  photopage: string;
  original: string;
  license: string;
  geo: any[];
  groups: any[];
  albums: any[];
  tags: any[];
  people: any[];
  notes: any[];
  privacy: string;
  comment_permissions: string;
  tagging_permissions: string;
  safety: string;
  comments: any[];
}
Feel free to adjust the interface based on your specific requirements. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!

Please rename this Photo interface to PhotoInfo, and apply this type to the photoInfo variable that you created. Please also consider that the "id" field of this photoInfo is the numeric unique ID of the photo, and that the photos array of the Album interface is an Array of strings, each one of those strings is acttually the ID of a photo, and the  "photo_DDDDDDDDDD.json" file has this ID in the DDDDDDDDDD portion of its name.

Response
Apologies for the confusion. I have updated the interface name to PhotoInfo and made the necessary changes to incorporate it into the code, considering the ID structure for the photos. Here's the updated code:
<script>
Please replace <path_to_backup_directory> and <path_to_restore_directory> with the actual paths to the directories you're using.

Now the code
