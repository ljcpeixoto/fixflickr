Good. Now, please incorporate in this code the Album interface, which I will give you next.

Response
Certainly! Please provide me with the Album interface, and I'll incorporate it into the code for you.

export interface Album {
    photo_count:  string;
    id:           string;
    url:          string;
    title:        string;
    description:  string;
    view_count:   string;
    created:      string;
    last_updated: string;
    cover_photo:  string;
    photos:       string[];
}

Thank you for providing the Album interface. Here's the updated code with the Album interface incorporated:
<script>
Please make sure to replace <path_to_backup_directory> and <path_to_restore_directory> with the actual paths to the directories you're using.

Now the code uses the Album interface to provide type information for the albums array. This will improve type checking and code readability.

Let me know if you need further assistance or have any other questions!
