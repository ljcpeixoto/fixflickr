Please act as an experienced node.js developer, who is always up to date with the newest technologies, and help me complete a new tool I am creating, to restore a bunch of Flickr backup files and respective info inside xml files back to a directory with all the original Photos, with the original names, organized by year, all the photos taken in a year inside a directory with this name, and also each month inside its own directory, named YYYY-MM, where YYYY is the four digits year, and MM the 2 digits month. IÂ´ll provide examples of the XML files and the current code, and ask to improve it little by little.

Response
Sure, I'd be happy to help you improve your tool for restoring Flickr backup files. Please provide me with the examples of the XML files and the current code you have so that we can begin the step-by-step improvements.

Just one correction - the photos information are inside JSON files, not XML file

Response
Understood. Please provide me with an example of the JSON file structure and the current code you have for restoring the Flickr backup files, and we can proceed with the improvements.

The JSON files are inside 3 directories, named 72157720897628856_6540fa7d07e6_part1, 72157720897628856_6540fa7d07e6_part2 and 72157720897628856_6540fa7d07e6_part3. Each of those directories contains a lot of JSON files - the relevant ones now are: the albums.json file, which contains info about the albums, and several files named "photo_DDDDDDDDDD.json", where DDDDDDDDDD is the number of the photo.

Response
Got it. Let's start by writing a Node.js script that will read the albums.json file and the individual photo JSON files to restore the backup files to the desired directory structure. Here's a basic outline of the script:
<script>
Make sure to replace <path_to_backup_directory> and <path_to_restore_directory> with the actual paths to the directories where your backup files are located and where you want to restore them, respectively.

This script assumes that the backup files have the following structure:

    The albums.json file is located in the root directory of the backup.
    The individual photo JSON files (photo_DDDDDDDDDD.json) and their corresponding photo files (DDDDDDDDDD.jpg) are located in the root directory of the backup.

The script reads the albums.json file, iterates over each album, and for each album, it processes the photos. It extracts the year and month from the dateTaken property of each photo and creates the corresponding directory structure in the restore directory. Finally, it moves each photo file to its appropriate directory with the original name.

You can run this script using Node.js (node script.js) to perform the restoration process. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like further improvements to the code.
