Please consider that the albums.json file actually contains one field name "albums", and that this field is an array of objects with the Album interface.

Response
Understood. I've updated the code to reflect the structure of the albums.json file where the albums field contains an array of objects with the Album interface. Here's the modified code:
<script>
Please replace <default_backup_directory> and <default_restore_directory> with the default directories you want to use if the arguments are not provided.
