Please consider that the actual jpg file of the photo is not inside the backupDirectory, but in one of several directories that are inside the directory that contains backupDirectory, and those directories are name data-download-1, data-download-2, data-download-3, etc. Each photo can be in any of those directories (data-download-xxx) - you must search for each photo before moving it to its final destinationPath.

Response (after the error, User asked to regenerate answer)
Understood. In that case, we need to modify the code to search for the photo file in the appropriate data-download-xxx directories within the parent directory of the backupDirectory. Here's the updated code:
<script>
Please replace <default_backup_directory> and <default_restore_directory> with the default directories you want to use if the arguments are not provided.
